# SetShifting in Different Task Spaces

# Project Description
<<<<<<< HEAD

# Goal is to model the impact of increasing the number and size of stimulus-dimensions on the strategies people apply to solve the task, and on the difficulty of intra- and extradimensional shifts.

# Repo includes script(s) for an attentional set-shifting task in which the complexity of the task space is manipulated by increasing the number of dimension and/or features within each dimension, and thus, the difficulty of ID versus ED shifts can be assessed separately.

# Repo also includes scripts for a family of reinforcement learning models that aim to assess the (learning) strategies that participants use to navigate the task space and inform choices/decisions. 
# Models vary in what aspects of the task (stimulus as a whole, stimulus-features, responses,...) participants learn on to solve the task.

# Master files that the models are based on are also included, and were based on work by JmxPearson (gitHub).

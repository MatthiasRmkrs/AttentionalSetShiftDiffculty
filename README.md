# SetShifting in Different Task Spaces

# Project Description
# Repo includes scripts for an attentional set-shifting task in which the complexity of the task space is manipulated by increasing the number of dimension and/or features within each dimension, and thus, the difficulty of ID versus ED shifts can be assessed separately.

# Repo also includes scripts for a family of reinforcement learning models that aim to assess the (learning) strategies that participants use to navigate the task space and inform choices/decisions. 
# Master files that the models are based on are also included, and were based on work by JmxPearson (gitHub).
